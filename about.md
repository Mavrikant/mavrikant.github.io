Hi, I'm an embedded software developer(C++) with 4+ years of experience. Currently, I'm working on an avionic project of [ESEN System](https://www.esensi.com.tr/) and pursuing my Software Engineering master's degree at Hacettepe University. 


Other than work and school; I spent my time writing technical stuff on my blog, developing pet projects on GitHub, and helping 
Wikipedia. 


After you check my blog  post you can also check my social media accounts and open source projects on my GitHub page.
